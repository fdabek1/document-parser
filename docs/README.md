## About

This is an optimized and easy to use template-based system meant for parsing clinical documents.  A template file is created for a certain category of documents and then the system smartly attempts to parse a set of documents and carefully gives errors and warnings.

This system contains checks for data types to ensure that the correct information is being extracted. 

See the [Installation](installation.md) for getting this system up and running.
